## Description

This is my fifth independent project for the Epicodus bootcamp program. The goal is create a class that can receive a person's age and convert that age to what it would be in different planets.

## Setting Up The Project
1. Download the files or clone the repository to your computer.
2. Open the project folder in your code editor of choice.
3. Install all required dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Run `npm run build` to generate files, and open the `dist/index.html` file to see the page.
5. Optionally, run `npm run serve` to start a dev server and see the files that way.
To set up `eslint` though, you need the following:

## Objectives
- Business logic has 100% line coverage with Jest.
- Each spec was committed before writing its corresponding code.
- Project utilizes ES6 features such as classes.
- Dependencies are managed with npm.
- webpack is used to lint, bundle, and process code.
- Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
- Required functionality was in place by the deadline.
- Project demonstrates understanding of week's concepts. If prompted, you are able to discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology.

### Further Exploration Objectives
- Add a UI to your application.
- Return the date of a user's next birthday on each planet.
- Return the age Keith Richards will be in dog years on the planet Jupiter in 2073.
- Assuming that the average lifespan of a mayfly is 5 minutes, determine how many mayfly lifespans a human user has lived and then compare it the current age (in Earth years) of our sun.
- Make your application look nice and give it a solar theme!
